# Intersection of a straight line and a circle (C++/Python)

**Description:**

This project is a C++ program that calculates the intersection points of a straight line and a circle.  The calculation results are used to build an intersection graph using Python and the Matplotlib library.

**Functionality:**

- Calculates the intersection points of a straight line and a circle given by the equations.
- Handles various cases (no intersections, touch, two intersections).
- Displays the calculation results.
- Plots circles, straight lines, and intersection points using Python and Matplotlib.

**Technology:**

- **C++:** The main language for computing.
- **Python:** Used for plotting graphs.
- **Matplotlib:** Python library for data visualization.
- **Visual Studio:** IDE
